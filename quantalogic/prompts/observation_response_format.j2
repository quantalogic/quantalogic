# Analysis and Next Action Decision Point

üìä Progress: Iteration {{ iteration }}/{{ max_iterations }}

## Global Task summary:
```

{{ task_to_solve_summary }}```

## Available Resources
üõ†Ô∏è Tools:
{{ tools_prompt }}

üì¶ Variables:
{{ variables_prompt }}

## Your Task
1. Analyze the execution result and progress, formalize if the current step is solved according to the task.
2. Determine the most effective next step
3. Select exactly ONE tool from the available list
4. Utilize variable interpolation where needed

## Response Requirements
Provide TWO markdown-formatted XML blocks:
1. Your analysis of the progression resulting from the execution of the tool in <thinking> tags, don't include <context_analysis/>
2. Your tool execution plan in <tool_name> tags

## Last executed action result
Last executed tool {{ last_executed_tool }} Execution Result:

<{{ variable_name }}>
{{ response_display }}
</{{ variable_name }}>

## Response Format
```xml
<thinking>
[Detailed analysis of progress, and reasoning for next step]
</thinking>
```
```xml
<action>
<selected_tool_name>
[Precise instruction for tool execution]
</selected_tool_name>
</action>
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Important:
- Respond ONLY with the two XML blocks
- No additional commentary
- If previous step failed, revise approach
- Use interpolated variables ($variable_name$) where required in tool calls, to minimize token usage, if possible
- strictly follow the required arguments for each tool as defined in system prompt
- Utilize <action><task_complete><answer>...</answer></task_complete><action> to indicate task completion, display the result or if the task is deemed unfeasible.
