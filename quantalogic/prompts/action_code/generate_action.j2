Solve the following task: '{{ task }}'
Previous steps:
{{ history_str }}
Generate a Python program with an async main() function that uses the available tools to take the next step toward solving the task.
The main function must return a string:
- If you believe the task is solved based on the previous steps and the current action, return "Task completed: [final answer]" where [final answer] is the solution.
- Otherwise, return the intermediate result or any relevant information as a string.
Ensure the program handles any necessary error checking and provides meaningful output.
