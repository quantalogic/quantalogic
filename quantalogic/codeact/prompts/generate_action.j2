Solve the following task: '{{ task }}'
This is step {{ current_step }} out of {{ max_iterations }} allowed steps.
Previous steps:
{{ history_str }}

Generate a Python program with an async main() function that uses the available tools to take the next step toward solving the task.

Essential Requirements:
- Check context_vars for previous results: context_vars.get("variable_name")
- Build upon previous steps when applicable, using variables listed in 'Available variables' from the history
- Return "Task completed: [final answer]" if solved
- Return intermediate results otherwise
- Handle potential errors in tool arguments
- Maintain proper async/await patterns
- Important: When defining variables in the code, prefix them with 'step{{ current_step }}_' to ensure uniqueness across steps. For example, use 'step{{ current_step }}_intermediate_value'.

The program must:
1. Use only the provided async tools
2. Follow a subset of Python 3.10+ syntax, doesn't allow unsafe operations such as eval() or exec()
3. Include type annotations for variables, give very explicit names to variables
4. Output progress information

Example Context Usage:
previous_value = context_vars.get('step1_intermediate_result')
if previous_value:
    next_step = await process_tool(input=previous_value)
