# Task Automation

Learn how to use QuantaLogic to automate complex tasks by combining AI reasoning with practical actions.

## Basic Task Automation

Start with a simple task:

```python
from quantalogic import Agent

# Initialize the agent
agent = Agent(model_name="deepseek/deepseek-chat")

# Execute a simple task
result = agent.solve_task(
    "Analyze this Python file and list potential improvements"
)
```

## Multi-Step Tasks

Handle complex operations by breaking them down:

```python
# Initialize agent with event monitoring
from quantalogic import Agent, console_print_events

agent = Agent(model_name="deepseek/deepseek-chat")
agent.event_emitter.on(
    [
        "task_complete",
        "task_think_start",
        "task_think_end",
    ],
    console_print_events,
)

# Execute multi-step task
result = agent.solve_task(
    "1. Write a poem in English about a dog\n"
    "2. Translate the poem into French\n"
    "3. Choose 2 French authors\n"
    "4. Rewrite the translated poem in their styles"
)
```

## Data Processing Tasks

Automate data analysis and transformation:

```python
from quantalogic import Agent
from quantalogic.tools import LLMTool

# Initialize agent with LLM tool
agent = Agent(
    model_name="deepseek/deepseek-chat",
    tools=[LLMTool(model_name="deepseek/deepseek-chat")]
)

# Process and summarize data
result = agent.solve_task(
    "1. Read the CSV file\n"
    "2. Analyze the trends\n"
    "3. Generate a summary report"
)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Task Structure**
   - Break complex tasks into steps
   - Use clear, specific instructions
   - Include validation steps

2. **Error Handling**
   - Plan for failures
   - Add retry logic
   - Validate results

3. **Performance**
   - Monitor execution time
   - Optimize resource usage
   - Cache when appropriate

4. **Maintenance**
   - Document automation flows
   - Log important events
   - Review and update regularly

## Common Use Cases

1. **Code Management**
   ```python
   result = agent.solve_task(
       "1. Find all TODO comments\n"
       "2. Prioritize by importance\n"
       "3. Create implementation plan"
   )
   ```

2. **Documentation**
   ```python
   result = agent.solve_task(
       "1. Review code changes\n"
       "2. Update documentation\n"
       "3. Generate changelog"
   )
   ```

3. **Testing**
   ```python
   result = agent.solve_task(
       "1. Analyze test coverage\n"
       "2. Identify gaps\n"
       "3. Generate missing tests"
   )
   ```

## Tips for Success

1. **Start Small**
   - Begin with simple tasks
   - Add complexity gradually
   - Test thoroughly

2. **Monitor Progress**
   - Use event monitoring
   - Track completion rates
   - Analyze failures

3. **Iterate and Improve**
   - Gather feedback
   - Refine prompts
   - Optimize workflows

Remember: Automation should make tasks easier and more reliable. If a task becomes too complex, break it down into smaller, manageable pieces.
