# Code Generation and Manipulation

Learn how to use QuantaLogic for advanced code operations like generating, analyzing, and modifying code. This guide shows you how to work with files and code at scale.

## Available Code Tools

QuantaLogic provides powerful tools for code operations:

```python
from quantalogic.tools import (
    ListDirectoryTool,      # List directory contents
    ReadFileBlockTool,      # Read specific blocks of code
    ReadFileTool,          # Read entire files
    ReplaceInFileTool,     # Make targeted replacements
    RipgrepTool,           # Search code patterns
    SearchDefinitionNames,  # Find function/class definitions
    WriteFileTool,         # Create new files
)
```

## Setting Up Code Agent

Create an agent with code-specific tools:

```python
agent = Agent(
    model_name="deepseek/deepseek-chat",
    tools=[
        SearchDefinitionNames(),
        RipgrepTool(),
        WriteFileTool(),
        ReadFileTool(),
        ReplaceInFileTool(),
        ReadFileBlockTool(),
        ListDirectoryTool(),
    ],
)
```

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example of generating code:

```python
from quantalogic import Agent

# Initialize agent with DeepSeek model
agent = Agent(model_name="deepseek/deepseek-chat")

# Generate a Fibonacci function
result = agent.solve_task(
    "Create a Python function that calculates the Fibonacci sequence"
)
print(result)
```

## Advanced Usage with Event Monitoring

For more complex tasks, you can monitor the agent's thinking process:

```python
from quantalogic import Agent, console_print_events
from quantalogic.tools import LLMTool

# Initialize agent with event monitoring
agent = Agent(
    model_name="deepseek/deepseek-chat",
    tools=[LLMTool(model_name="deepseek/deepseek-chat")]
)

# Set up event monitoring
agent.event_emitter.on(
    [
        "task_complete",
        "task_think_start",
        "task_think_end",
        "tool_execution_start",
        "tool_execution_end",
    ],
    console_print_events,
)

# Execute a multi-step task
result = agent.solve_task(
    "1. Write a function to validate email addresses\n"
    "2. Add comprehensive error handling\n"
    "3. Include type hints and docstrings"
)
```

## Code Analysis Tools

QuantaLogic provides tools for code analysis and manipulation:

```python
from quantalogic.tools import (
    ListDirectoryTool,     # List files and directories
    ReadFileTool,          # Read file contents
    RipgrepTool,           # Search code patterns
    WriteFileTool,         # Create new files
)
```

### Common Use Cases

1. **Code Search**
```python
# Search for specific patterns in code
result = agent.solve_task(
    "Find all function definitions that handle file operations"
)
```

2. **Code Generation with Tests**
```python
# Generate code with test cases
result = agent.solve_task(
    "Create a date validation function with unit tests"
)
```

3. **Code Refactoring**
```python
# Improve code structure
result = agent.solve_task(
    "Refactor this function to follow SOLID principles:\n"
    "[paste your code here]"
)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**
   - Begin with basic tasks
   - Add complexity gradually
   - Test generated code thoroughly

2. **Use Event Monitoring**
   - Track agent's thinking process
   - Debug complex operations
   - Understand decision patterns

3. **Handle Errors**
   - Always validate generated code
   - Include error handling
   - Test edge cases

4. **Documentation**
   - Request clear docstrings
   - Include usage examples
   - Document assumptions

## Next Steps

- Try the examples in your own projects
- Experiment with different prompts
- Combine multiple operations
- Share your feedback and improvements

Remember: The agent works best with clear, specific instructions. Break down complex tasks into smaller steps for better results.
