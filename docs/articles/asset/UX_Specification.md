# UX Specification for Calculator

## Overview
The calculator is a basic computational device designed for ease of use, featuring a pastel color scheme and a straightforward layout. This specification outlines key elements such as layout, labeling, color scheme, and user interaction.

## Layout
- **Dimensions**: Approx. 6 inches (height) x 4 inches (width).
- **Screen**: Positioned at the top, slightly angled for better visibility.
  - **Size**: 2 inches (height) x 4 inches (width).
  - **Display Type**: LCD with a digital readout.
- **Button Layout**: 
  - Organized in a grid format.
  - 4 rows, 5 columns for numerical and operational buttons.
  - Additional row for function keys (e.g. memory, clear).

## Button Details
- **Labeling**:
  - **Numerical Keys (0-9)**: Clearly labeled with numbers in a large, sans-serif font to enhance readability.
  - **Operational Keys**: 
    - Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (ร), Division (รท) - color-coded for quick identification (e.g., orange for addition).
    - **Equals (=)**: Prominently placed and colored differently (e.g., bright red).
  - **Function Keys**: 
    - **MC, MR, M+, M-**: Memory functions located on the left side, using contrasting colors for visibility.
    - **C**: Clear function, distinct color (e.g., bright orange), located at the bottom for easy access.

## Color Scheme
- **Background**: Soft pastel pink for the body of the calculator.
- **Button Colors**: 
  - Light pastel colors (e.g., yellow, blue, green, purple) for numerical keys.
  - Different shades for operational keys to distinguish functions.
- **Text Color**: Dark gray or black for high contrast against pastel backgrounds.

## Font Styles
- **Font Type**: Sans-serif, ensuring legibility.
- **Font Size**: 
  - Screen: Large (approx. 24 pt) for numbers.
  - Buttons: Medium (approx. 16 pt) for labels.

## Iconography
- **Icons**: 
  - None used for a minimalistic approach; reliance on clear text labels.
  
## Hierarchy
- **Visual Hierarchy**:
  - Screen at the top, clearly visible.
  - Numerical buttons prominently displayed in the center.
  - Operational keys slightly larger or in contrasting colors to denote importance.
  - Function keys positioned distinctly at the left.

## Positioning
- **Screen**: Fixed at the top, angled for easy viewing.
- **Buttons**: 
  - Centralized for thumb access.
  - Memory functions placed to the left for quick access.

## Interaction & Feedback
- **Button Press Feedback**: 
  - Soft tactile response on button press.
  - Potential audible click sound for confirmation.
- **Display Update**: Instantaneous update of calculations on the screen.

## Animations
- **Transitions**: 
  - Minimal animations; primarily static with immediate feedback.
  - Potential for a slight visual effect (e.g., highlight) on button press for user confirmation.

## Conclusion
This UX specification aims to ensure the calculator is user-friendly, visually appealing, and functionally efficient, making it suitable for users of all ages. The pastel color scheme adds a modern aesthetic while ensuring that essential functionalities are easily accessible.
