## What is CodeAct?

Quantalogic CodeAct is a framework within the Quantalogic ecosystem that enables the creation of AI agents capable of reasoning and acting using the ReAct paradigm. It integrates language models, extensible tools, and interactive interfaces (CLI, shell, and SDK) to empower users to solve tasks, engage in conversations, and customize agent behavior.

### CodeAct Principle, ReAct, and the CodeAct Paper

CodeAct is inspired by the *["ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629)* paper (Yao et al., 2022), and further formalized and empirically validated in the recent work *"Executable Code Actions Elicit Better LLM Agents"* ([Yang et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.01030v4)).

The ReAct paradigm combines reasoning (generating plans or thoughts) with acting (executing actions) in an iterative loop. CodeAct extends this concept by making **executable code**—specifically Python—the primary action and communication format between agent and environment. This approach leverages language models' extensive code pre-training, allowing agents to:

- **Reason**: Analyze tasks and generate plans or code based on context and history.
- **Act**: Emit Python code as actions, which are executed in the environment; the agent receives outputs (including errors) as observations.
- **Iterate**: Repeat the cycle, incorporating feedback from code execution until the task is resolved or a limit is reached.

#### Why Executable Code Actions?
Empirical results from the CodeAct paper show that using code as the action format leads to better tool-use performance for LLM agents—especially open-source models—compared to JSON or text-based tool calls. This is attributed to LLMs' familiarity with code and Python's rich ecosystem for task decomposition, control flow, and error handling.

A critical component that makes CodeAct's executable code actions possible is the [quantalogic-pythonbox](https://github.com/quantalogic/quantalogic-pythonbox) project. PythonBox provides a secure, sandboxed environment for executing Python code, ensuring that agent-generated code can be run safely, with resource limits and isolation from the host system. This robust execution backend enables the CodeAct agent to interact with its environment confidently, handling both standard outputs and errors, and supports advanced features such as multi-turn tool use and dynamic package installation.

CodeAct thus provides a natural, powerful, and extensible interface for building robust LLM agents that can solve complex, multi-step tasks using code.

#### Example: CodeAct Agent Interaction
A CodeAct agent typically emits actions in the form of executable Python code blocks. For example:

```
<execute>
print("Hello, World!")
</execute>
```

The agent receives the result of this execution (output or errors) and uses it for further reasoning and actions. This loop continues until the agent determines the task is complete.

For more details and example prompts, see Appendix E of the [CodeAct paper](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.01030v4).

### ReAct Agent

The `CodeActAgent` is the core of CodeAct, implementing the ReAct loop:

1. **Task Input**: Receives a task (e.g., "Solve 2 + 2").
2. **Reasoning Phase**: Uses a `Reasoner` to generate a plan or code, leveraging language models.
3. **Action Phase**: Employs an `Executor` to run the code or invoke tools.
4. **Evaluation**: Checks if the task is complete, iterating if necessary.

The agent maintains context through a history manager and supports tools for specialized tasks, making it ideal for multi-step problem-solving.

### Architecture

CodeAct’s architecture is designed for modularity and scalability, as shown below:

```bash
poetry run quantalogic_codeact task "Solve 2 + 2" --streaming
```
List available tools or models:
```bash
poetry run quantalogic_codeact list-toolboxes
poetry run quantalogic_codeact list-models
```

### Using the Agent SDK

The Agent SDK enables developers to programmatically create and control agents, offering fine-grained control over reasoning, execution, and tool integration. Below is an example demonstrating task-solving, progress monitoring, and custom tool integration.

```python
from quantalogic_codeact.codeact.agent import Agent
from quantalogic_codeact.codeact.agent_config import AgentConfig
from quantalogic_toolbox import create_tool, Tool

# Define a custom tool
@create_tool
async def fibonacci(n: int) -> int:
    """Calculate the nth Fibonacci number."""
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Fibonacci is not defined for negative numbers")
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return a

# Initialize agent with configuration
config = AgentConfig(
    model="deepseek/deepseek-chat",
    max_iterations=5,
    enabled_toolboxes=["math_tools"],
    tools=[fibonacci],
    personality={"traits": ["logical", "concise"]}
)
agent = Agent(config=config)

# Define an observer to monitor progress
def monitor_event(event):
    if event.event_type == "StepStarted":
        print(f"Step {event.step_number} started")
    elif event.event_type == "ActionExecuted":
        print(f"Step {event.step_number} result: {event.result_xml}")
    elif event.event_type == "TaskCompleted":
        print(f"Task completed with answer: {event.final_answer}")

agent.add_observer(monitor_event, ["StepStarted", "ActionExecuted", "TaskCompleted"])

# Solve a task synchronously
task = "Calculate the 6th Fibonacci number"
result = agent.sync_solve(task)
final_answer = result[-1].get("result", "No result")
print(f"Final Answer: {final_answer}")

# Chat asynchronously
async def run_chat():
    response = await agent.chat("Explain the Fibonacci sequence")
    print(f"Explanation: {response}")

import asyncio
asyncio.run(run_chat())
```

#### Example Output
```
Step 1 started
Step 1 result: <ExecutionResult><Status>Success</Status><Value>8</Value>...</ExecutionResult>
Task completed with answer: 8
Final Answer: 8
Explanation: The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0, 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...). The 6th number is 8.
```

#### ReAct Loop Visualization
The SDK executes the ReAct loop as follows:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant A as Agent
    participant R as Reasoner
    participant E as Executor
    participant T as Tools
    U->>A: Solve "6th Fibonacci number"
    A->>R: Generate plan
    R-->>A: Plan: Use fibonacci tool
    A->>E: Execute fibonacci(6)
    E->>T: Call fibonacci tool
    T-->>E: Result: 8
    E-->>A: Result XML: 8
    A-->>U: Final Answer: 8
```

#### SDK Features
- **Custom Configuration**: Set model, tools, iterations, and personality via `AgentConfig`.
- **Event Monitoring**: Track events like `StepStarted`, `TaskCompleted` using observers.
- **Dynamic Tools**: Register custom tools (e.g., `fibonacci`) at runtime.
- **Sync/Async Support**: Use `sync_solve`/`sync_chat` for synchronous calls or `solve`/`chat` for asynchronous operations.

```yaml
model: "deepseek/deepseek-chat"
max_iterations: 5
max_history_tokens: 2000
```

Example CLI usage:
```bash
poetry run quantalogic_codeact task "Calculate the square root of 16" --model gemini/gemini-2.0-flash
```

Example SDK usage for a custom task:
```python
from quantalogic_codeact.codeact.agent import Agent

agent = Agent()
result = agent.sync_solve("What is the square root of 16?")
print(result[-1].get("result", "No result"))
```

### Configuration

CodeAct uses a YAML-based configuration system, typically stored at `~/.quantalogic/config.yaml`. Example:
```yaml
model: "gemini/gemini-2.0-flash"
max_iterations: 5
max_history_tokens: 2000
enabled_toolboxes:
  - math_tools
reasoner:
  name: "default"
  config:
    temperature: 0.7
executor:
  name: "default"
profile: "math_expert"
personality:
  traits:
    - witty
    - helpful
tools_config:
  - name: math_tools
    enabled: true
    config:
      precision: "high"
```

Use `/config save` or `/config load` in the shell to manage configurations, or modify the file directly.
