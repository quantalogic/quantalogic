        "title": "Educational Questionnaire Generator Overview",
        "claims": "The Educational Questionnaire Generator is a Python script designed to transform markdown files into interactive quizzes using AI. It extracts facts, generates multiple-choice questions, evaluates their quality and accuracy, shuffles the options, and saves the output as a JSON file. The tool is suitable for teachers, learners, and trivia enthusiasts, aiming to make knowledge acquisition more engaging and efficient. It leverages cutting-edge LLMs like Gemini for intelligent fact extraction and question creation, streamlining the quiz-making process and boosting learning through tailored content. The script automates the traditionally manual task of quiz creation, saving time and offering versatility across various educational contexts, from classrooms to self-study.",

        "title": "`uv`-Powered Shebang and Dependency Management",
        "claims": "The script utilizes a `uv`-powered shebang (`#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run`) to specify its execution environment. This shebang tells the system to run the script with `uv`, a Rust-based Python tool known for its speed and efficiency. The script also includes a metadata block specifying Python 3.12+ and a list of dependencies (e.g., loguru, litellm, pydantic). When `uv` executes the script, it automatically downloads the required Python version (if needed) and installs all listed packages in a temporary, isolated environment. This approach eliminates the need for manual installations using `pip install` and ensures a conflict-free execution environment, enhancing portability and simplifying setup.",

The `Fact` model consists of a title, claims, and sources. The `FactsList` model contains a list of `Fact` objects. The `QuestionnaireItem` model includes fields for the fact title, question, options (ranging from 3 to 6), correct answers (as a list of 1-based indices), an explanation, and a flag indicating if multiple-choice answers are possible. The `Questionnaire` model comprises a list of `QuestionnaireItem` objects. These models ensure data integrity and facilitate structured data processing throughout the script's workflow.",

        "claims": "The fact extraction process involves reading a markdown file, extracting detailed facts using AI, and then generating questions based on these facts. For example, given a markdown file containing information about the Moon landing, the script extracts the key fact that \"On July 20, 1969, NASA's Apollo 11 mission landed humans on the Moon. Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walked the surface, while Michael Collins orbited.\" The AI then generates a question such as \"Who walked on the Moon during Apollo 11?\" with options like \"Armstrong & Aldrin\", \"Collins & Glenn\", and \"Shepard & Grissom\", identifying \"Armstrong & Aldrin\" as the correct answer. This demonstrates the AI's ability to extract relevant information and formulate meaningful questions.",

        "claims": "The script includes a question verification step where each generated question is evaluated for quality. This involves assessing the question's relevance, plausibility, correctness, clarity, and the quality of the explanation provided. The evaluation process assigns ratings (on a scale of 1-5) for each of these aspects and provides specific comments on the question's strengths and weaknesses. This ensures that only high-quality, accurate, and informative questions are included in the final questionnaire, enhancing the overall educational value of the generated quiz. This rigorous evaluation helps maintain the integrity and reliability of the quiz content.",
