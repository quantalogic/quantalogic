In the heart of Paris, where the Seine whispers low,  
Time dances in shadows, with a gentle, endless flow.  
Cobblestones echo the footsteps of the past,  
Where lovers and dreamers believed moments could last.  

The Eiffel stands tall, a sentinel of dreams,  
Reflecting the sun's ever-changing beams.  
Its iron lacework, a testament to the years,  
Witness to laughter, to whispers, to tears.  

In caf√©s where poets once spilled their hearts,  
Time lingers in brushstrokes and culinary arts.  
The aroma of coffee, the clink of a glass,  
Moments suspended, refusing to pass.  

Notre Dame's bells, though now silent and still,  
Chime in the memories that time cannot kill.  
Gargoyles keep watch from their age-worn perches,  
Guarding the stories, the songs, and the searches.  

The Louvre holds secrets in its grand, hallowed halls,  
Paintings and sculptures where history calls.  
Each brushstroke and chisel, a mark of the clock,  
Capturing seconds in marble and chalk.  

Paris, the city where time twirls and bends,  
In the laughter of strangers, in the comfort of friends.  
A tapestry woven with threads of the years,  
Worn with the wonder, the hopes, and the fears.  

So here, in this city of romance and light,  
Time holds its breath, in the day and the night.  
For in Paris, every heartbeat, every sigh,  
Is a dance with eternity, beneath the vast sky.
