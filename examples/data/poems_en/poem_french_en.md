In the heart of Paris, where the Seine softly whispers,  
Time twirls in the shadows, in an eternal flow.  
The cobblestones echo with the steps of ages past,  
Where lovers and dreamers believed they could freeze suspended moments.

The Eiffel Tower rises, sentinel of dreams,  
Reflecting the shifting rays of the sovereign sun.  
Its iron lace, witness to bygone years,  
Has seen laughter and tears, and whispers lost.

In the caf√©s where poets bared their souls,  
Time lingers in brushstrokes, in flames.  
The aroma of coffee, the crystal of a glass,  
Suspend the moments, refusing to fall silent.

The bells of Notre-Dame, though mute and still,  
Resound in memories that time could not shatter.  
The gargoyles watch from their worn perches,  
Guardians of stories, of songs, of odysseys.

The Louvre preserves secrets in its sacred halls,  
Paintings and sculptures where history is told.  
Each brushstroke, each chisel's sharpened edge,  
Captures eternity in marble and light.

Paris, city where time bends and marvels,  
In the laughter of passersby, in the embrace of friends.  
A tapestry woven from ancient threads,  
Worn by splendor, hopes, and sorrows.

Thus, here, in this city of light and love,  
Time holds its breath, from dusk to dawn.  
For in Paris, every heart, every sigh,  
Dances with eternity, beneath the opening sky.
