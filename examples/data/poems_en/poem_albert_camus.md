In the heart of Paris, where the Seine murmurs with a melancholic softness,  
Time drifts like a stranger in the shadows, an endless loop.  
The cobblestones, silent witnesses, echo with the footsteps of bygone centuries,  
Where lovers and dreamers sought to grasp the ungraspable.

The Eiffel Tower rises, an iron sentinel facing the absurd,  
Capturing the play of light from an indifferent sun.  
Its rigid structure, frozen by time,  
Has seen laughter, tears, whispers that fade away.

In the caf√©s, where poets have laid bare their inner revolt,  
Time dissolves into an endless tableau, into sparks.  
The aroma of coffee, the clink of a glass,  
Suspend the moment, refusing to vanish into nothingness.

The bells of Notre-Dame, though silent,  
Resonate in a memory that time could not erase.  
The gargoyles, from their perch worn by the years,  
Watch over the stories, the songs, the human quests.

The Louvre, guardian of secrets, in its halls steeped in mystery,  
Houses works where history tells itself.  
Each brushstroke, each chisel strike,  
Freezes eternity in marble, making it tangible.

Paris, a city where time wavers and marvels,  
In the laughter of passersby, in the embrace of allies of the moment.  
A tapestry woven from ancient threads,  
Worn by splendor, hopes, tragedies.

Thus, in this city of light and disillusion,  
Time holds its breath, from dusk to dawn.  
For in Paris, every heart, every sigh,  
Dances with eternity, under an eternally open sky.
