In the heart of Paris, where the Seine softly whispers,  
Time pirouettes in shadows, in an eternal flow.  
The cobblestones echo with steps of ages past,  
Where lovers and dreamers sought to freeze suspended moments.

The Eiffel Tower rises, sentinel of dreams,  
Reflecting the shifting rays of the sovereign sun.  
Its iron lace, witness to bygone years,  
Has seen laughter and tears, and whispers now lost.

In caf√©s where poets bared their souls,  
Time lingers in brushstrokes, in flickering flames.  
The aroma of coffee, the crystal of a glass,  
Suspend the moments, refusing to fall silent.

The bells of Notre-Dame, though mute and still,  
Resound in memories time could not shatter.  
The gargoyles keep watch from their weathered perches,  
Guardians of stories, of songs, of odysseys.

The Louvre preserves secrets in its sacred halls,  
Paintings and sculptures where history is told.  
Each stroke of the brush, each chisel's sharp edge,  
Captures eternity in marble and light.

Paris, city where time bends and marvels,  
In the laughter of passersby, in the embrace of friends.  
A tapestry woven with ancient threads,  
Worn by splendor, hopes, and sorrows.

Thus, here, in this city of light and love,  
Time holds its breath, from dusk to dawn.  
For in Paris, every heart, every sigh,  
Dances with eternity, beneath the opening sky.
