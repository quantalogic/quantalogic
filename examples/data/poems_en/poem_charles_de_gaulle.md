To rewrite this poem in the style of Charles de Gaulle, one must adopt a more solemn tone, imbued with grandeur and historical depth. De Gaulle had a way of expressing himself that emphasized historical continuity, resilience, and the glory of France. Here is a version inspired by his style:

In the heart of Paris, where the Seine murmurs its history,
Time unfolds its course, a witness to an eternal nation.
The cobblestones still echo with the footsteps of bygone centuries,
Where once lovers and dreamers sought to etch the infinite.

The Eiffel Tower, a symbol of our collective destiny,
Reflects the shifting light of the imperial sun.
Its iron structure, guardian of ancient times,
Has seen the birth of laughter, tears, and the hopes of France.

In the caf√©s, bastions of creative souls,
Time stretches, captured in the momentum of genius.
The aroma of coffee, the crystal of glasses,
Seize the ephemeral, defying the silence of the past.

The bells of Notre-Dame, silent yet eternal,
Resonate in memories that time could not erase.
The gargoyles, from their venerable posts,
Watch over the tales, the songs, the epics of our land.

The Louvre, sanctuary of the secrets of our heritage,
Houses paintings and sculptures, narratives of France's history.
Each stroke, each chisel mark,
Fixes eternity in marble and light.

Paris, a city where time bows before grandeur,
In the laughter of passersby, in the embrace of friends.
A tapestry woven with threads of centuries,
Worn by splendor, hopes, and sorrows.

Thus, here, in this city of light and courage,
Time holds its breath, from dusk till dawn.
For in Paris, every heart, every sigh,
Dances with eternity, under the sky that opens to the future.
