Ever feel like you're manually gluing AI components together instead of building truly *smart systems*? ðŸ§©

Iâ€™ve got something that can help!

Introducing: **QuantaLogic Flow Examples** (free & open-source!). Think of it as a LEGO set for AI.

This framework lets you:
âœ… Integrate LLMs seamlessly.
âœ… Configure pipelines with simple YAML.
âœ… Orchestrate paper analysis, PDF processing, and even story generation.

Founders and engineers are using it to:
ðŸŽ¯ Automate research breakdowns.
ðŸŽ¯ Convert technical docs to markdown.
ðŸŽ¯ Generate tutorials from their workflows.

Hereâ€™s the best part: Template nodes are included, so you don't have to start from scratch. Build once, reuse everywhere.

ðŸ‘‡ **Let's brainstorm!** ðŸ‘‡
What AI workflow would *you* automate first?

Comment below:
â†’ Analyze contracts?
â†’ Create course content?
â†’ Generate synthetic training data?

PS Tag 3 AI/ML friends who'd find this useful!
