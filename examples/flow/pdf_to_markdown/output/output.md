If it's tight, it's right”

Iterating fast
allows to
learn fast ..

# Good Practice 4- OPENNESS

<> defensiveness

Tolerate failure
Tolerate pivots, tolerate changes in direction
Tolerate challenges to what you're doing

Yes – but it requires an organizational culture:
psychological safety net (cf. Amy Edmonson)

This tolerance requires Trust and Safety
