## CodeAct vs ReAct: What's the Difference?

QuantaLogic supports both the classic **ReAct** paradigm and its advanced extension, **CodeAct**:

- **ReAct** (Reason + Act):
  - Based on the [ReAct paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629), this approach lets agents *reason* (think step-by-step) and *act* (use tools or code) in a loop. It's great for tasks where language models need to plan, use tools, and adapt to feedback.

- **CodeAct**:
  - Builds on ReAct by making **executable Python code** the main language for agent actions. Instead of just calling tools or outputting text, the agent writes and runs code, observes the results (including errors), and iterates until the task is solved.
  - This approach is inspired by recent research ([Yang et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.01030v4)) showing that executable code actions enable more capable and reliable LLM agents.
  - CodeAct is ideal for complex, multi-step tasks, advanced automation, and scenarios where precise, verifiable actions are needed.

**Summary**:
- Use **ReAct** for flexible reasoning with tool use.
- Use **CodeAct** for tasks where generating and executing code is the best way to solve a problem or automate a workflow.

### The Three Modes: Your Superpowers

#### 1. ReAct Framework: Dynamic Task-Solving
**Why**: Tackle open-ended tasks like coding or research with creative flair.  
**What**: Combines LLM reasoning with tools to iterate toward solutions.  
**How**: The agent thinks, acts, and loops until the task is complete.

**Example**: Debug some code.
```bash
quantalogic task "Debug this Python code: def add(a, b): return a - b"
```
**Flow**:
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    User->>Agent: "Debug code"
    Agent->>LLM: "Analyze error"
    LLM-->>Agent: "Subtraction should be addition"
    Agent->>PythonTool: "Fix code"
    PythonTool-->>Agent: "def add(a, b): return a + b"
    Agent-->>User: "Fixed code!"
```

**Memorization Trick**: ReAct = **R**eason + **A**ct, like a detective solving a mystery step-by-step.

#### 2. Flow Module: Structured Automation
**Why**: Perfect for repeatable processes like data pipelines or content creation.  
**What**: A system of nodes (tasks) connected by transitions, run by an engine.  
**How**: Define nodes, link them, and let the workflow hum.

**Example**: Process text.
```python
from quantalogic.flow import Workflow, Nodes

@Nodes.define(output="processed")
def uppercase(text: str) -> str:
    return text.upper()

workflow = Workflow("uppercase").build()
result = await workflow.run({"text": "hello world"})
print(result["processed"])  # "HELLO WORLD"
```

**Diagram**:
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Start] --> B[Uppercase Node]
    B --> C[End]
    A -->|Observer| D[Log: NODE_START]
    B -->|Observer| E[Log: NODE_END]
    style A fill:#dfd,stroke:#333
    style C fill:#dfd,stroke:#333
```

**Memorization Trick**: Flow = a recipe—nodes are ingredients, transitions are steps, and the engine is the chef.

**Learn More**: Explore the [Flow YAML DSL Specification](./quantalogic/flow/flow_yaml.md) for advanced workflows.

#### 3. Chat Mode: Natural Conversations
**Why**: Ideal for interactive Q&A or quick info with a touch of tool power.  
**What**: A conversational AI that calls tools when needed, keeping chats smooth.  
**How**: Engages naturally, using tools via ReAct’s XML system.

**Example**: Check the weather.
```python
from quantalogic import Agent

agent = Agent(model_name="gpt-4o", chat_system_prompt="You’re a travel guide")
response = agent.chat("What’s the weather in Paris?")
print(response)
# Output: "I’ll look it up! Paris is sunny, 20°C today."
```

**Memorization Trick**: Chat = your AI bestie—talks, listens, and grabs tools like a search engine when curious.
